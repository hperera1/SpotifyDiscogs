# Spotify Record Store App

Originally started with Create React App but we are doing something else here.

AuthorizationCode is the flow that OAuth needs because we are going to be asking the user for permission to use their things and we need to authroize their credentials. We are interacting with them and not just getting something from the backend.

index.html stores our frontend.

server.js has our backend.
